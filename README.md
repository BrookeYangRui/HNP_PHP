# Open Taint Tracking Analyzer

A comprehensive open-ended static analysis tool for discovering Host Header usage patterns in PHP frameworks.

## Overview

This tool performs **Open Taint Tracking** analysis to discover all Host Header usage patterns in PHP frameworks without any sink restrictions. It provides comprehensive insights into how host data flows through the codebase.

## Analysis Method

- **Open-ended Taint Tracking**: No sink restrictions, let taint flow freely
- **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find all host usage patterns, not just security issues
- **Pattern Classification**: Categorize usage into 8 different types
- **Security Analysis**: Identify validation, risk usage, and context-dependent cases

## Results (Laravel Example)

- **33 taint propagation points** discovered
- **12 files** analyzed
- **6 usage patterns** identified:
  - URL Construction: 15 (45.5%)
  - Other: 9 (27.3%)
  - Direct Return: 4 (12.1%)
  - Object Properties: 3 (9.1%)
  - Validation: 1 (3.0%)
  - String Operations: 1 (3.0%)
- **Security Analysis**:
  - Explicit validation: 4 points
  - No explicit validation: 10 points
  - Context-dependent: 19 points

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 open_taint_analyzer.py
```

### Direct Analysis
```bash
python3 open_taint_analyzer.py --framework 1
```

### Available Frameworks
1. Laravel
2. Symfony
3. WordPress
4. CodeIgniter
5. CakePHP
6. Yii2
7. All Frameworks

## Generated Reports

- **open_discovery.json**: Raw Semgrep discovery results
- **open_taint_data.csv**: Structured analysis data with usage patterns
- **open_analysis_summary.json**: Analysis summary with statistics
- **call_graph/host_call_graph.json**: Enriched call graphs with per-finding slices, callers, and risk annotations

## Key Features

- **No Sink Restrictions**: Discovers all host usage patterns
- **Pattern Classification**: 8 different usage pattern types
- **Security Analysis**: Validation and risk assessment
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 175% more findings than restrictive methods
- **Framework Support**: Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Yii2
- **Call Graph Insights**: Automatic extraction of host-related call chains and contextual slices per finding

## Analysis Types

1. **Direct_Return**: Direct return of host data
2. **URL_Construction**: Host data used in URL building
3. **Header_Setting**: Host data in HTTP headers
4. **Configuration**: Host data in configuration
5. **Validation**: Host data in validation logic
6. **String_Operations**: Host data in string manipulation
7. **Object_Properties**: Host data assigned to object properties
8. **Other**: Other usage patterns

## Benefits

- **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find all host usage points
- **Research Foundation**: Understanding of framework behavior
- **Security Insights**: Identify validation and risk patterns
- **Academic Value**: Objective analysis without subjective risk assessments

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Semgrep
- PHP frameworks in `frameworks/` directory

## Example Output
